# ImageSteganograpphy
implemented a basic image steganography program in Python using the OpenCV and Pillow libraries. 
This program allows you to hide a message within an image and later decode it. I'll provide a brief overview of the code and some suggestions for improvement:

**#Encoding:**

The data2binary function converts text or image data into binary format.
The hidedata function hides the binary data in the image by modifying the least significant bits of each pixel's color channels.

**Decoding:**

The find_data function extracts the hidden binary data from the image.
The decode function converts the binary data back to human-readable form.
Main Program (stegnography function):

The program provides a simple user interface, allowing the user to either encode or decode a message.
It uses a loop to continue the process until the user chooses to exit (entering '0').

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

Add more robust error handling to handle cases such as invalid file names, missing files, or incorrect user inputs.
User Feedback: Provide clearer messages and feedback to the user during the encoding and decoding processes.
Security: This basic steganography method is not secure for sensitive information. Consider more advanced techniques if security is a concern.
Code Documentation: Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of critical sections of the code.
Code Organization: Consider organizing the code into separate functions or classes for better readability and maintainability.
Encryption: Consider adding encryption to the message before hiding it to enhance security.
